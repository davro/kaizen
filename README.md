# kaizen

Kaizen is a compound of two Japanese words that together translate as "good change" or "improvement."
However, Kaizen has come to mean "continuous improvement" through its association with lean methodology and principles.

Gemba (現場) is the Japanese term for “actual place,” often used for the shop floor or any place where value-creating work actually occurs.
